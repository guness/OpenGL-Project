OpenGL Project for CS465
===================


This project contains an OS X Desktop Application written in C++, Objective C and GLSL languages. Main purpose of the application is to perform some shading technologies on a randomly generated surface in a 3D world.

----------


Requirements
-------------

Requirements of the project was to implement a 3D world using OpenGL. World must contain single point light source with ambient support. Light and surface must show clearly shininess, diffuse, ambient, specular effects. Also must support more than one mapping, shading technologies.

> **Used technologies in application:**

> - Phong shading, Gouraud shading
> - Wireframe render, surface render
> - Bump mapping, Texture mapping

Controls
-------------
After focusing on window, you can use WASD and mouse to navigate around. Zoom and change of angle can be controlled also with mouse.
